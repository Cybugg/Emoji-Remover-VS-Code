## Installation

1. Open VS Code.  
2. Go to the Extensions panel.  
3. Search for `Emoji Cleaner` and install it.  
4. Alternatively, if you have the `.vsix` file:  
   ```bash
   code --install-extension emoji-cleaner-0.1.3.vsix

## Usage

1. Open a workspace or project in VS Code.  
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac).  
3. Run the command: **Remove All Emojis From Project**.  
4. The extension will scan all files and remove any emojis it finds.  
5. Once finished, a notification will appear confirming the operation.  

**Note:** Always keep a backup or use version control. Deleted emojis are not recoverable.

### Performance

- The extension scans all files in the workspace and removes emojis.
- Works efficiently on small and medium projects.
- For very large projects, consider excluding folders like `node_modules` for faster execution.

## How It Works

The extension scans all files in your workspace and performs the following steps:

1. Recursively traverses all directories starting from the workspace root.  
2. Filters files to only include supported text-based formats.  
3. Reads each file’s content.  
4. Applies a Unicode-aware regular expression to remove emojis:

```typescript
/[\p{Emoji_Presentation}\p{Emoji}\u200d]+/gu

```
### Explanation of the Regex

- `\p{Emoji}` – Matches all Unicode-defined emojis.  
- `\p{Emoji_Presentation}` – Matches characters that are displayed as emojis by default.  
- `\u200d` – Zero-Width Joiner, used in composite emoji sequences.  
- `+` – Matches one or more consecutive emoji-related characters.  
- `g` – Global flag, replaces all occurrences in the text.  
- `u` – Unicode mode, required for `\p{...}` support.  

The extension then writes the cleaned content back to each file and displays a notification once the process is complete.

## Supported File Types

The extension processes the following text-based file types:

- JavaScript / TypeScript: `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`  
- JSON: `.json`   (with safe mode)
- HTML / CSS: `.html`, `.css`  
- Markdown / Text: `.md`, `.txt`  
- YAML: `.yml`, `.yaml`  

Additional file types can be added by modifying the extension code or configuration.
