## How It Works

The extension scans all files in your workspace and performs the following steps:

1. Recursively traverses all directories starting from the workspace root.  
2. Filters files to only include supported text-based formats.  
3. Reads each file’s content.  
4. Applies a Unicode-aware regular expression to remove emojis:

```typescript
/[\p{Emoji_Presentation}\p{Emoji}\u200d]+/gu
