Here is the **updated and corrected README in clean Markdown**, matching the new safe-regex version, the JSON-safe logic, and the fixed glob behavior.

# Emoji Cleaner

**Emoji Cleaner** is a Visual Studio Code extension that removes all emojis from your project files — safely.
If you're tired of seeing random smileys, flags, invisible Unicode gremlins, or AI-generated emoji artifacts inside your code, this extension cleans them up **without breaking your files**.

No emojis. No corruption. No stress.

## Features

* Safely remove Unicode emojis from your entire workspace
* **Safe JSON cleaning** — prevents corruption in `package.json`, configs, etc.
* Supports complex emoji sequences (flags, skin tones, ZWJ emojis)
* Skips binaries and respects excluded folders
* Supports custom file extensions
* Output logs for transparency
* “Dry run” mode for previewing changes
* Fast, lightweight, and stable

---

## Installation

### From Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to the Extensions panel
3. Search for **Emoji Cleaner**
4. Install it

### From `.vsix`

```bash
code --install-extension emoji-cleaner-0.1.4.vsix
```

---

## Usage

1. Open a workspace in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
   or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
3. Run:

**Remove All Emojis From Project**

4. The extension scans all supported files
5. A summary notification appears when finished

**Tip:** Always use version control or keep backups before mass-cleaning.

### Performance

* Optimized for typical codebases
* Large monorepos may benefit from excluding folders like:

  * `node_modules`
  * `dist`
  * `.git`
  * `.next`

## How It Works

Emoji Cleaner performs the following steps:

1. Recursively searches the workspace for supported file types
2. Applies ignore rules for folders/files you exclude
3. Reads each file
4. If JSON → parses it safely, sanitizing **both keys and values**
5. If text → applies the emoji regex
6. Writes updated content only if changes exist

### Emoji Regex Used (Safe Version)

```ts
const EMOJI_REGEX =
  /(\p{Extended_Pictographic}|\p{Emoji_Presentation}|[\u{1F1E6}-\u{1F1FF}])+/gu;
```

### Explanation

* `\p{Extended_Pictographic}` → matches visible emoji characters
* `\p{Emoji_Presentation}` → emoji-presenting characters
* `\u{1F1E6}-\u{1F1FF}` → regional flag indicators
* Works without stripping unrelated characters
* Prevents corruption often caused by overly broad emoji regex patterns

This ensures **only actual emojis** are removed — no false positives.

---

## Supported File Types

* JavaScript / TypeScript → `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`
* JSON → `.json` (fully safe mode)
* HTML / CSS → `.html`, `.css`
* Markdown / Text → `.md`, `.txt`
* YAML → `.yml`, `.yaml`

You can customize the list in VS Code settings.
